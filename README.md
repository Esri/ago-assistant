## Instructions

1. If you want to contribute development or make changes to your own version of AGO-Assistant, fork and then clone this repo  
-OR-  
If you want to simply use the app on your own network, [download a recent release](https://github.com/Esri/ago-assistant/releases).
2. Run and try the samples.

#### Building the app
This project uses npm scripts to automate building and optimizing the application. It does a handful of things for you that will make it easier to configure and deploy this application to your own web server.

  * Download and install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
  * Download or clone this project to your machine.
  * Go to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
  * [Register the app in your portal](http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/linux/add-items.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_0D1B620254F745AE84F394289F8AF44B) to obtain an `appId` for using the OAuth dialog to log in. Be sure to add the correct redirect URI (the location where your app will be hosted).
  * Update the config section in [`package.json`](package.json) with your portal's url and new `appId`.
  * Run `npm run build` to generate an optimized build in the `build` folder.
    * You can run the app locally for development and testing with the command `npm run serve`. Your browser should automatically open to `localhost:8080`. 
    * Deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your own web server to distribute the app throughout your organization.
