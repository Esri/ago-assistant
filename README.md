## Instructions

1. Fork and then clone the repo -OR- [download a recent release](https://github.com/Esri/ago-assistant/releases). 
2. Run and try the samples.

#### Using Grunt
This project uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate building the application for deployment on a web server. It does a handful of things for you that will make life easier when setting up this application.

  * Download and install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
  * Download or clone this project to your machine.
  * Go to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt and run `npm install`. (This should automatically download the project's dependencies, including Grunt).
  * Run `grunt` from the command line. If you get an error saying `grunt is not recognized...` you may need to run the command `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install it globally.
  * An optimized build of the app will be generated in the `build` folder.
